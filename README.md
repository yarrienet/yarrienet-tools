## yarrienet-tools

Repository containing tools used to maintain [yarrie.net](http://yarrie.net).

### Structure

Most of the tools are specialized and built to complete a highly specific task, however most of the code outside of `tools`, `scripts`, and `main.go` is generic and potentially helpful for any project.
